# Moving To Gitlab

[Victory Icon Theme on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/newhoa/el-nuove)

I am in the process of moving this project, as well as my other Github projects, to Gitlab. I will leave the files here for a month or two. After that I may leave the Readme with this redirect notice or delete my account. Thank you all for your stars, watches, suggestions, kind comments and everything else. I really do appreciate it. I hope if you're reading this and have a Gitlab account you will find me there. I may also eventually mirror it on Bitbucket.

# El Nuove Icon Theme

An Icon collection I made many years ago, a recreation of NuoveXT icons as SVG with additional icons from the elementary icon theme, tango, gnome, Meliae, and Faenza (and a few poorly made original icons). This theme is pretty rough, I was just learning how icon themes worked at the time and learning how to use an SVG editor. (Inkscape!) Originally called Victory Icon Collection, I renamed it El Nuove to reflect that most of the icons here are from or edits of the Elementary icons and the NuoveXT icons.
